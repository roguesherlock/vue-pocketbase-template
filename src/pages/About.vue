          I think I really like this stack. It certainly is not one of the fancy
          new stacks going around right now but it's something that works for
          me.

          I think that's the most important thing. I'm able to be productive in
          this stack. And I'm able to build things that I want to build.

          I just wanted to share it here in case anyone wanted to take any
          inspiration.
